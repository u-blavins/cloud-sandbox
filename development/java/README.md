# Java

## Description
Develop Java Skills through tutorials and practicals

## Background
> - Created 1991 but released 1995
> - Java acquired and owned by Oracle

Object-oriented programming language
- happens to object
- execution
- talk to each other

Platform independent - write once run anywhere
Strong type checking language - respect variable types

Automatic garbage collection - auto find unused object, remove
from memory

Provides multi-threading

Secure by default - no pointers

## Java Program Execution
Write a Java Program .java
Compile program - .class file produced - compiled file / byte code
Can be run on any platform - any
Write Java program and compile program

- Platform Independence

## Anatomy of Java
Do not need the JDK on all machines, just compiles Java Programs to Bytecode.
The JRE is what runs the .class files and reads the .class files from different machines.

### JDK

Java Development Kit

- installation of Java
- Provide other components
- Write Java Program and Compile code through compiler (part of JDK)

### JRE

- Java Runtime Environment
- Can run .class files through JRE - help of JVM, Class Libraries and other supporting libraries

### JVM

- Java Virtual Machine
- Virtual Env where program is run - where .class file is run
- Needs runtime libraries (Class Libraries) - program runs smoothly
- Other libraries will also be used if it requires a different library
